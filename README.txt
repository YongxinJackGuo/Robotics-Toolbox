- Myfunctions: A list of functions frequently used in robotics field.

- Final Project: A project using Jacobian-based motion planning combined with Special Euclidean SE(3) Interpolation on 7-DOF Baxter and 6-DOF Elbow Manipulator, along with a LaTex generated report.

- HWs: 
    * HW1: RR direct and inverse kinematics for 2-Link manipulator, also for RRR
    * HW2: Conversion between different representation of rotation such as RPY, AxisAngle and Quaternion
    * HW3: Exponential forward kinematics for SCARA and Elbow 
    * HW4: Spatial and body velocity of the end effector
    * HW5: Inversed kinematics using  Kahan-Paden subproblems
